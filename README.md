Assistant
================
Toolbox full of Sass helpers and mixins, copied from project to project and built up over time. Frontend equivalent of a "dotfiles" repo. Unlikely to be of use as a dependency or library, but might carry some inspirational or educational value.

Usage
----------------
Copy the entire `scss` directory into your project's stylesheets folder. Rename it to `assistant` or something of the sort. Import files with abandon.

You probably shouldn't use this right now. I might polish up the "installation" process later.
